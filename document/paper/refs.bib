The Neural Engineering Framework ({NEF}) proposes one such theory, but has not yet gathered significant empirical support, partly due to the technical challenge of building and simulating large-scale models with the {NEF}. Nengo is a software tool that can be used to build and simulate large-scale models based on the {NEF}; currently, it is the primary resource for both teaching how the {NEF} is used, and for doing research that generates specific {NEF} models to explain experimental data. Nengo 1.4, which was implemented in Java, was used to create Spaun, the world's largest functional brain model (Eliasmith et al., ). Simulating Spaun highlighted limitations in Nengo 1.4's ability to support model construction with simple syntax, to simulate large models quickly, and to collect large amounts of data for subsequent analysis. This paper describes Nengo 2.0, which is implemented in Python and overcomes these limitations. It uses simple and extendable syntax, simulates a benchmark model on the scale of Spaun 50 times faster than Nengo 1.4, and has a flexible mechanism for collecting simulation results.},

The generally accepted models describing the decision process in these tasks are the integrator models. These models suggest that perceptual evidence is accumulated over time until a decision is made. Therefore, the final decision is based solely on recent perceptual information. In behaviorally more relevant tasks such as foraging, it is however probable, that the current choice also depends on previous experience. To understand the implications of considering previous experience in an integrator model we investigate it using a cognitive architecture ({DAC}9) with a robot performing foraging tasks. Compared to an instantaneous decision making model we show that an integrator model improves performance and robustness to task complexity. Further we show that it compresses the information stored in memory. This result suggests a change in the way actions are retrieved from memory leading to self-generated actions.},

	abstract = {The brain is the most complex system we know of. Despite the wealth of data available in neuroscience, our understanding of this system is still very limited. Here we argue that an essential component in our arsenal of methods to advance our understanding of the brain is the construction of artificial brain-like systems. In this way we can encompass the multi-level organisation of the brain and its role in the context of the complete embodied real-world and real-time perceiving and behaving system. Hence, on the one hand, we must be able to develop and validate theories of brains as closing the loop between perception and action, and on the other hand as interacting with the real world. Evidence is growing that one of the sources of the computational power of neuronal systems lies in the massive and specific connectivity, rather than the complexity of single elements. To meet these challenges-multiple levels of organisation, sophisticated connectivity, and the interaction of neuronal models with the real-world-we have developed a multi-level neuronal simulation environment, iqr. This framework deals with these requirements by directly transforming them into the core elements of the simulation environment itself. iqr provides a means to design complex neuronal models graphically, and to visualise and analyse their properties on-line. In iqr connectivity is defined in a flexible, yet compact way, and simulations run at a high speed, which allows the control of real-world devices-robots in the broader sense-in real-time. The architecture of iqr is modular, providing the possibility to write new neuron, and synapse types, and custom interfaces to other hardware systems. The code of iqr is publicly accessible under the {GNU} General Public License ({GPL}). iqr has been in use since 1996 and has been the core tool for a large number of studies ranging from detailed models of neuronal systems like the cerebral cortex, and the cerebellum, to robot based models of perception, cognition and action to large-scale real-world systems. In addition, iqr has been widely used over many years to introduce students to neuronal simulation and neuromorphic control. In this paper we outline the conceptual and methodological background of iqr and its design philosophy. Thereafter we present iqr's main features and computational properties. Finally, we describe a number of projects using iqr, singling out how iqr is used for building a "synthetic insect".},

	abstract = {The interplay between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) is fundamental to spatial cognition. Complementing hippocampal place coding, prefrontal representations provide more abstract and hierarchically organized memories suitable for decision making. We model a prefrontal network mediating distributed information processing for spatial learning and action planning. Specific connectivity and synaptic adaptation principles shape the recurrent dynamics of the network arranged in cortical minicolumns. We show how the {PFC} columnar organization is suitable for learning sparse topological-metrical representations from redundant hippocampal inputs. The recurrent nature of the network supports multilevel spatial processing, allowing structural features of the environment to be encoded. An activation diffusion mechanism spreads the neural activity through the column population leading to trajectory planning. The model provides a functional framework for interpreting the activity of {PFC} neurons recorded during navigation tasks. We illustrate the link from single unit activity to behavioral responses. The results suggest plausible neural mechanisms subserving the cognitive "insight" capability originally attributed to rodents by Tolman \& Honzik. Our time course analysis of neural responses shows how the interaction between hippocampus and {PFC} can yield the encoding of manifold information pertinent to spatial planning, including prospective coding and distance-to-goal correlates.},

	abstract = {This thesis develops a theoretical model for the wiring complexity of wide classes of systems, relating the degree of connectivity of a circuit to the dimensionality of its interconnect technology. This model is used to design an efficient, hierarchical interconnection network capable of accommodating large classes of circuits. Predesigned circuit elements can be incorporated into this hierarchy, permitting semi-customization for particular classes of systems (e.g., photoreceptors included on vision chips). A polynomial-time programming algorithm for embedding the desired circuit graph onto the prefabricated routing resources is presented, and is implemented as part of a general design tool for specifying, manipulating and comparing circuit netlists.

This thesis presents a system intended to facilitate analog circuit design. At its core is a {VLSI} chip that is electrically configured in the field by selectively connecting predesigned elements to form a desired circuit, which is then tested electrically. The system may be considered a hardware accelerator for simulation, and its large capacity permits testing system ideas, which is impractical using current means. A fast-turnaround simulator permitting rapid conception and evaluation of circuit ideas is an invaluable aid to developing an understanding of system design in a {VLSI} context.

We have constructed systems using both reconfigurable interconnection switches and laser-programmed interconnect. Prototypes capable of synthesizing circuits consisting of over 1000 transistors have been constructed. The flexibility of the system has been demonstrated, and data from parametric tests have proven the validity of the approach.

Finally, this thesis presents several new circuits that have become key components in many analog {VLSI} systems. Fast, dense and provably safe one-phase latches and hierarchical arbiters are presented, as are a low-noise analog switch, an isotropic novelty filter, a dense, active high-resistance element, and a subthreshold differential amplifier with a large linear input range.},

Many computational paradigms were inspired by brain research, such as Boolean neuronal logic [{McCulloch} \& Pitts, 1943], the perceptron [Rosenblatt, 1958], attractor neural networks [Hopfield, 1982] and cellular neural nets [Chua \& Yang, 1988]. All these paradigms abstract biological circuits to artificial neural networks, i.e. interconnected units (neurons) that perform computations based on the connections between the units (synapses). Here we present a novel computational framework based on polychronous wavefront dynamics. It is entirely different from an artificial neural network paradigm, rather it is based on temporal and spatial patterns of activity in pulse-propagating media and their interaction with transponders, which create pulses in response to receiving appropriate inputs, e.g. two coincident input pulses. A pulse propagates as a circular wave from its source to other transponders. Computations result from interactions between transponders, and they are encoded by the exact physical locations of transponders and by precise timings of pulses. We illustrate temporal pattern recognition, reverberating memory, temporal signal analysis and basic logical operations using polychronous wavefront computations. This work reveals novel principles for designing nanoscale computational devices.},

The routing scheme extends the Address-Event Representation ({AER}) protocol for spike event communication to a modular, hierarchical architecture supporting efficient implementation of global synaptic inter-connectivity across a cellular matrix of message parsing axonal relay nodes at varying spatial scales. This paper presents a probabilistic framework for analyzing trade-offs in throughput and latency of synaptic communication as a function of load and geometry, and simulation results verifying the statistics of traffic flow across the architecture.},

	abstract = {We present a spiking neural model capable of solving a popular test of intelligence, Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices ({RPM}). The central features of this model are its ability to dynamically generate the rules needed to solve the {RPM} and its biologically detailed implementation in spiking neurons. We describe the rule generation processes, and demonstrate the model's ability to use the resulting rules to solve the {RPM} with similar performance and error patterns to human subjects. Investigating the rules in more detail, we show that they successfully capture abstract patterns in the data, enabling them to generalize to novel matrices. We also show that the same model can be used to solve a separate reasoning task, and demonstrates the expected positive correlation in performance across tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of the biologically detailed implementation by using the model to connect behavioral and neurophysiological data. Specifically, we investigate two neurophysiological explanations of cognitive decline in aging: neuron loss and representational “dedifferentiation”. We show that manipulations to the model that reflect these neurophysiological hypotheses result in performance changes that match observed human behavioral data.},

We then compare this model to animal data in the bandit task, which is used to test rodent learning in conditions involving forced choice under rewards. Our results indicate a good match in terms of both behavioral learning results and spike patterns in the ventral striatum. The model successfully generalizes to learning the utilities of multiple actions, and can learn to choose different actions in different states. The purpose of our model is to provide both high-level behavioral predictions and low-level spike timing predictions while respecting known neurophysiology and neuroanatomy.},

	shorttitle = {How to Build a Brain},
	abstract = {In this book, Chris Eliasmith presents a new approach to understanding the neural implementation of cognition in a way that is centrally driven by biological considerations. He calls the general architecture that results from the application of this approach the Semantic Pointer Architecture ({SPA}), based on the Semantic Pointer Hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, higher-level cognitive functions in biological systems are made possible by semantic pointers. These pointers are neural representations that carry partial semantic content and can be built up into the complex representational structures necessary to support cognition. The {SPA} architecture demonstrates how neural systems generate, compose, and control the flow of semantics pointers. Eliasmith describes in detail the theory and empirical evidence supporting the {SPA}, and presents several examples of its application to cognitive modeling, covering the generation of semantic pointers from visual data, the application of semantic pointers for motor control, and most important, the use of semantic pointers for representation of language-like structures, cognitive control, syntactic generalization, learning of new cognitive strategies, and language-based reasoning. He agues that the {SPA} provides an alternative to the dominant paradigms in cognitive science, including symbolicism, connectionism, and dynamicism.},

By embodying models of the brain on robotic platforms, researchers can investigate the roots of biological intelligence and work towards the development of truly intelligent machines. This book provides a broad introduction to this groundbreaking area for researchers from a wide range of fields, from engineering to neuroscience. Case studies explore how robots are being used in current research, including a whisker system that allows a robot to sense its environment and neurally inspired navigation systems that show impressive mapping results. Looking to the future, several chapters consider the development of cognitive, or even conscious robots that display the adaptability and intelligence of biological organisms. Finally, the ethical implications of intelligent robots are explored, from morality and Asimov's three laws to the question of whether robots have rights.},
